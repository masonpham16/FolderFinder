# FolderFinder
App to find a folder quickly without needing to scroll tirelessly

## The folder at work has hundreds of job folders in a single folder.
## of course I could use the search bar on the top right of the folder,
## but I'd still have to open the folder, click on a folder to find that folder, then do the searching.

## I much rather have an app that lets me type in a partial string and get the resulting folder I was looking for.

# how to use

## you can compile this java script after you adjust the search directory in the code.
## for now it's opened through terminal or any IDE of your choice




## I tried using GraalVM and Launch4j to create a .exe file but no success yet.
## Still in early stages, but would love to be able to continue to test the app.
